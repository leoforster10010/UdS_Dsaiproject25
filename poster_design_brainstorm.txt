Introduction:	We want to predict the frequency spectra given by a arbitrary wave generator (AWG) by modeling the resulting frequency spectra
	  	given by the interference of an fixed input frequency and the AWG frequency spectra happening inside an acoustic-optical modulator (AOM).
Motivation: 	Why is controlling the AOM output spectrum important?
			-> in experimental physics (especially in the field of quantum photonics) a concrete frequency sprectrum is often needed
			-> using our predictions, the people needing a certain frequency spectrum can tell which frequence spectrum they would need the AWG to generate such that the wanted output frequency spectrum is archived
			-> for given experiments, the real time predictions can save a lot of time, which would be needed to figure out the wanted spectrum by hand 
		What challenges arise due to the nonlinear and complex input-output relationship?
			-> the computation of those complex relations in the real world is nearly impossible
			-> by certain methods i.e. Machine Learning, those relationships can be learned and predicted accordingly

Objective:  	*How do we do what we want*
Visualize data processing steps: 
		We train our prediction model on training data based an AWG frequency spectra based on a 22 dimensional vector and the output sprectra as an result of the interference in the AOM as 202 buckets of frequencies.
		Those are calculations are made by an AOM Modellation given by the Project Donors (alot of math idfk).
		Generating those 22 dimensional vectors such that we insure low baised is done by randomly selecting points in the surface of a 22 dimensional sphere.

Poster Tips:
-Use big, readable fonts. Main text ~24 pt; headings ≥36 pt.
- Minimize text blocks. Favor bullet points and visual aids.
- Make plots clear. Ensure axis labels and legends are legible.
- Use color wisely. Keep it consistent with your key figure’s real/imag color scheme (e.g., blue/orange).
- Tell a story. Guide the viewer from motivation to method to results.
