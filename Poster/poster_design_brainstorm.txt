Title + Include your names, affiliations, supervisor, and project donor.
Introduction (What do we actually want to do)
Motivation: 
- Why is controlling the AOM output spectrum important?
- What challenges arise due to the nonlinear and complex input-output relationship?
- Mention relevance to quantum optics or real-time feedback control.
- Real-Life Application / Show System Overview Diagram
- > Experimental Setup (Laser → AOM → Beam Splitter → Photodetectors): Show how heterodyne measurement is used; Explain constant laser input frequency and continuous monitoring.
Objective (How do we do what we want)
Visualize data processing steps (How we get training data)
Model Architecture:
- Brief summary or diagram (e.g., MLP, CNN, etc.)
- What makes the model suitable for nonlinear mappings?
- Performance metrics or comparison between models.
Results
- Example input/output spectra from model
- Comparison of predicted vs. actual AOM spectra
- Error metrics, learning curve, etc.
Conclusion (Summary of findings)

Poster Tips:
-Use big, readable fonts. Main text ~24 pt; headings ≥36 pt.
- Minimize text blocks. Favor bullet points and visual aids.
- Make plots clear. Ensure axis labels and legends are legible.
- Use color wisely. Keep it consistent with your key figure’s real/imag color scheme (e.g., blue/orange).
- Tell a story. Guide the viewer from motivation to method to results.
