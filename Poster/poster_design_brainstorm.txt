Introduction:	We want to predict the frequency spectra given by a arbitrary wave generator (AWG) by modeling the resulting frequency spectra
	  	given by the interference of an fixed input frequency and the AWG frequency spectra happening inside an acoustic-optical modulator (AOM).
Motivation: 	Why is controlling the AOM output spectrum important?
			-> in experimental physics (especially in the field of quantum photonics) a concrete frequency sprectrum is often needed
			-> using our predictions, the people needing a certain frequency spectrum can tell which frequence spectrum they would need the AWG to generate such that the wanted output frequency spectrum is archived
			-> for given experiments, the real time predictions can save a lot of time, which would be needed to figure out the wanted spectrum by hand 
		What challenges arise due to the nonlinear and complex input-output relationship?
			-> the computation of those complex relations in the real world is nearly impossible
			-> by certain methods i.e. Machine Learning, those relationships can be learned and predicted accordingly

Poster Tips:
-Use big, readable fonts. Main text ~24 pt; headings ≥36 pt.
- Minimize text blocks. Favor bullet points and visual aids.
- Make plots clear. Ensure axis labels and legends are legible.
- Use color wisely. Keep it consistent with your key figure’s real/imag color scheme (e.g., blue/orange).
- Tell a story. Guide the viewer from motivation to method to results.
