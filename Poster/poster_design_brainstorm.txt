Introduction:	
		In the experimental setup the spectrum of an incoming laser beam is changed in an acousto-optical modulator (AOM) by interfering with an applied radio frequency (rf) signal coming from
		an arbitrary wave generator (AWG). 
		We want to predict the frequency spectrum given to the AWG by modeling the resulting frequency spectra given a desired, complex output spectrum which should be then produced by the AOM.
		
		
Motivation: 	
		Why is controlling the AOM output spectrum important?
			-> in experimental physics (especially in the field of quantum photonics) a concrete, desired frequency sprectrum is often needed
			-> using the model, it is possible to get the required AWG configuration for generating a desired output spectrum
			-> for given experiments, the real time predictions can save a lot of time, which would be needed to figure out the wanted spectrum by hand 
			
		What challenges arise due to the nonlinear and complex input-output relationship?
			-> the computation of those complex relations in the real world is nearly impossible
			-> by certain methods i.e. Machine Learning, those relationships can be learned and predicted accordingly

Objectives:
		Find a suitable Model that is able to predict the required AWG input spectra given the desired AOM output spectra.
		Observe the impact of different hyperparameters on model performance.
		Observe the impact of changes in the simulation & non-linearity on the model performance.
		(Future objective): Find a model architecture, that is able to perform consistently over different simulations.

		In general, the AWG input spectrum has 11 real valued & 11 complex valued frequencies ranging from 95 to 105 mHz. Similar, the AOM output spectrum has 101 real valued & 101 complex valued frequencies ranging from 50 to 150 mHz.
		The training data is completly generated without noise or missing values.
		For this we sample the potential AWG input spectra by randomly selecting points on the surface of a 22 dimensional sphere, ensuring that the norm is constant.
		The AOM output is obtained by simulating the AOM using a given, not 100% accurate but in complexity similar mathematical model.
		Using both the simulated AOM output spectra as input and the sampled AWG input spectra as desired output, we train the model.
